• When the game starts, the application displays the name of the player who has completed the game in the minimum number of keystrokes.<br/> 
• Then, it displays the numbers from zero to eight in random order in a 3×3 grid.The objective of the game is to arrange the numbers in ascending order.<br/>
• Numbers can be moved up, down, left, or right within the grid by swapping them with the vacant space i.e zero.<br/> 
• The number of keystrokes to complete the game should be counted. If the count is less than the record count, the player will be asked to enter his/her name.
